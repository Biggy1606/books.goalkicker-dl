Goalkicker is a web repository collection of e-books on multiple Computer Science topics available freely for download.

However, there are a lot of books, and one might need them offline.

And there are books added often, formatting changed, content updated.

A simple Py script to rule them all.

Just ```python3 app.py``` and wait.
